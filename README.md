## Context
Smoking will kill you. Anyone who smokes should use vaping as an enjoyable means to kick the habit. The only risk is taking up a different, albeit infinitely safter habit.

With that out of the way (and in spite of the bizarre public health stances taken by countries around the world), vaping has become mainstream. It caters to a variety of users with very different wants and expectations, from the older generation just looking to improve their health, to the hobbyists spending vast sums on their hardware.There are many online vaping stores out there, but they tend to be busy and bloated, selling anything you might ever need but with little style. The simplest and most crucial part of the industry is the e-liquid itself, and that's where Moose Juice comes in.

## UX

<span id="ux-overview"></span>

### Overview
Unconcerned with selling hardware in its myriad forms, Moose Juice can focus on providing nothing but the highest quality, home-brewed e-liquid and delivering a great user experience. By using an aesthetic not typically seen in larger vaping e-commerce stores alongside an accessible rewards system, the company hopes to retain its clientelle and be guided by their feedback. Converting a sale will rely on quickly signposting potential customers to relevant products and then giving them options.

In summary, the two questions asked by the site should be "What's your taste?" and "How do you vape?"

#### Flavours
Flavour and choice are paramount at Moose Juice. That's what will keep people off cigarettes for good. Options to filter by common vaping flavour profiles (bakery, dessert, fruit etc) are complimented by the ability to search for individual flavour notes (cinnamon, cream, apple etc). When browsing for a new juice to try, most users will go straight for an individual flavour and then make a choice based on its popularity.

#### Brands
From an e-liquid perspective all vapers will fall into one of three categories, which Moose Juice caters for in its brands.

**Big Moose**

For use with 'sub-ohm' devices, which get through a lot of juice and put out large vape clouds. This type of e-liquid has a thicker consistency due to a higher ratio of vegetable glycerin (VG) to propylene glycol (PG) and as sub-ohm devices use it up quickly, needs to come in larger bottles. Due to the TPD Regulations it cannot be sold pre-mixed with nicotine.

**Mini Moose**

One of two Moose Juice brands aimed at users of the more discreet 'pod' systems. These juices have a 50:50 PG/VG ratio and come in a variety of pre-mixed freebase nicotine strengths. The TPD Regulations do not allow pre-mixed e-liquids to be sold in bottles larger than 10ml.

**Salty Moose**

These pre-mixed juices use nicotine salts rather than freebase, providing a much quicker absorbtion rate akin to that of traditional cigarettes and a smoother 'throat hit' on the inhale.

The different compositions of these e-liquids mean that certain flavour combinations are better suited to one brand than another. Moose Juice's expertise in understanding these differences is what makes them so good. The flavour mix of an individual product is therefore not suitable to include in each of the three brands.

## Features
<span id="features-current"></span>

### Current

**1. Material design**
MaterializeCSS features:
- [Cards](https://materializecss.com/cards.html)
- [Forms](https://materializecss.com/text-inputs.html)
- [Menu dropdown](https://materializecss.com/dropdown.html)
- [Modals](https://materializecss.com/modals.html)
- [Sidenav](https://materializecss.com/sidenav.html)
- [Toasts](https://materializecss.com/toasts.html)

**2. Secure passwords**
When registering for the site, the user's password is hashed so that it is not revealed to the database owner.

**3. CRUD functionality**

Visitors can:
- View all activities
- View all categories.

Users can:
- Add their own activities
- Edit their own activities 
- Delete their own activities.

The admin can:
- Add their own activities
- Edit any users' activities
- Delete any users' activities
- Add a category
- Edit a category
- Delete a category.

**4. Image uploads**
Rather than having to find a URL for an image, users can upload their own files. This encourages them to provide their own content, but if they skip this step then a default image is displayed from the relevant category.

**5. Image resizing**
Prior to uploading an image, a user's file is resized so that it does not adversely affect site load times, and also gives some control over its dimensions.

**6. User profile**
Users can view all activities they have created in one place and easily edit or delete them.

**7. Admin rights**
The admin has the additional ability to:
- Edit or delete any activity on the site from its View Activity page
- Add categories
- Edit a category summary or image (but they cannot edit the name of a category to preserve relationship integrity)
- Delete categories from the Categories page, with measures for preserving relational integrity for activities no longer associated with a category.

**8. Confirm delete**
When the user or admin clicks to delete an activity or category, a modal pops up to confirm they wish to do so to prevent accidental deletion.

**9. Category reassignment on deletion**
When the admin chooses to delete a category which has associated activities, these activities are moved to the 'Unassigined' category and are still visible on the site.

**10. Search**
All users can search for keywords appearing in:
- Activity title
- Activity summary
- Activity description
- Activity required equipment
Activities can be filtered by category from the Categories page and also by target age or activity author by clicking on the associated tag from the Activities, View Activity or Profile pages.

**11. Pagination**
The Activities page (and any search or filters applied) will limit the number of activities visible to 9 in order to reduce the number of images loaded and keep the focus on the content. As individual users are unlikely to be adding much more than 9 activities, it makes sense not to paginate the Profile page to avoid spilling onto a second page in this rare instance.

**12. Access protection**
Routes to restricted functions such as add, edit and delete (for both session user and admin) are protected so that they cannot be accessed by brute force via the URL.

**13. 404 and 500 error handling**
Pages for 404 and 500 errors keep the user on the site when something goes wrong, allowing them to return to the content with minimal disruption.
